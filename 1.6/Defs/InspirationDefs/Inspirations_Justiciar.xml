Through the vision, [PAWN_pronoun] realized that only by wallowing in the agony of withdrawal symptoms of a drug can [PAWN_pronoun] be freed of sinful joy.\n\n[PAWN_pronoun] is hyper-fixated on this revelation, and will collapse into a binge of drugs and deep despair if [PAWN_pronoun] cannot experience a full day of withdrawal symptoms within the next quadrum.</beginLetter>

Through the vision, [PAWN_pronoun] saw blood - the blood of [PAWN_possessive] kin - flowing like a river to a sea of black nothingness.\n\nShaken by the revelation, [PAWN_pronoun] is convinced that [PAWN_pronoun] must send a member of [PAWN_possessive] bloodline into the embrace of the void personally. Should [PAWN_pronoun] fail to do so, a mindless rage of murderous intent will overcome [PAWN_objective] as despair sets in.</beginLetter>

        <beginLetter>{0} has glimpsed the Dark God and received a commandment! [PAWN_pronoun] saw a vision... but could hear nothing at all. It was a vision in which life continued without a single, wretched, vile, unconsciable, aggravating, damnable noise was to be made. It was majestic.\n\nEnthralled by the beauty of the silence in the revelation, [PAWN_pronoun] refuses to speak and has become completely silent. The world will continue its horrific cacophany around [PAWN_objective], but [PAWN_pronoun] will not contribute to it... for a year. True silence can only be achieved when the last heretic is found and made to beg and plead for the Dark God's mercy, and this will require noise.</beginLetter>

In a vision of a world beautifully bereft of life, [PAWN_pronoun] realized there can be no place for abundance in it - and so [PAWN_pronoun] must reject it and instead embrace scarcity in its entirety.\n\n[PAWN_possessive] obsession can only be satisfied by fasting and plunging into fervent madness. Should [PAWN_possessive] fail to achieve this in time, [PAWN_pronoun] will suffer a catastrophic mental sublimation and flee from the colony... or simply perish if unable to.</beginLetter>

[PAWN_pronoun] must spend no more than ten percent of the next ten days in darkness to endure this trial.
